Part |1|2|3|4|Jason could not fulfil his promise. he knew the love between him and Medea, was false, forced upon them by Hera and Aphrodite. Jason tried to explain these things to Medea. But she was blinded by rage, She had given up her whole life for Jason, her father, her kingdom, her brother, and yet he cannot bear to marry her in return? Medea lashed out in anger killing the argonauts in-front of Jason. She used her sorcery to get rid of Jason forever. But it wasn’t enough, she set her sights in what was left of Jasons family. Jason was right, she did not know Jason very well at all, for if she did, she would not have gone to Iolcus to kill the rest of his family as well. Hera watched with a satisfied face, for she had achieved her goal, not in the way she expected or planned, but that hardly mattered as long as Pelias suffered.
