Completing the Task|Zero|Zero|Zero|Zero|Jason did not accept the ointment offered by Medea, as he believed it was his duty to complete the tasks alone, and did not need help. Confident in his own abilities he challenged the flame breathing bulls. However he should have accepted the ointment, as when he walked into the room, he was engulfed in flames, he rolled around on the floor trying to put them out but failed to see them charging at him.
