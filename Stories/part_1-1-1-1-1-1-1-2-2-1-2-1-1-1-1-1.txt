Revenge|Zero|Zero|Zero|Zero|Medea was furious at the idea, She asked if all she had done for him meant nothing, but he replied that his thanks would go to Aphrodite for making them fall in love, rather than her. Jason had not known the truth, that Medea was not under the control of Aphrodite or Eros, even still Medea became furious at Jason for breaking their vows, and so she went on to kill the princess who Jason fell for, and to spite Jason she killed the sons she and him bore. She cursed Jason to be alone until he died as killing him would be a mercy compared to what he did to her. She then ran away to the Athens on a chariot of dragons, sent by Helios whom is her grandfather. There she lived out the rest of her life, she had cursed Jason, satisfied he would be alone for the rest of his life, she left him to wallow in his own self pity, maybe one day he would even come back to Medea, having regretted his actions. Medea could only hope.
