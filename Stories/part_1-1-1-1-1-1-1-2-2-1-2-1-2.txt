Declining Jason's Offer|Zero|Zero|Zero|Zero|Medea did not see why she would go with Jason, they were strangers, and she already had quite a fulfilling life living how she had been her whole life. She declined his request and he took off back to the Argo. Medea was not sure what happened to Jason after that, the only hint she had was when her Brother returned, golden fleece in hand. Of course Medea's actions in aiding Jason would not go unpunished by her father, but she was lucky and her father could not bear to see her executed. Instead, she was exiled and disowned, destined to wander the country for the rest of her days.|mid
