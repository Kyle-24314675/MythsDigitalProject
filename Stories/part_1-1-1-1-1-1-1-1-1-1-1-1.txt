Medea's wrath|Zero|Zero|Zero|Zero|Jason wanted to marry the princess of Corinth, but Medea was furious at the idea, She asked if all she had done for him meant nothing, but he replied that his thanks would go to Aphrodite for making them fall in love, rather than her.  Medea became furious at Jason for breaking their vows, and so she went on to kill the princess who Jason fell for, and too spite Jason she killed the sons she and him bore. She cursed Jason to be alone until he died as killing him would be a mercy compared to what he did to her. She then ran away to the Athens on a chariot of dragons, sent by Helios whom is her grandfather. Jason, having lost the favour of Hera and his Medea, spent the rest of his life alone, and one day as he grew old, looking up at the hull of the argo, reminiscing his wonderful adventures and friends. He had grown tired of living and so prayed to Zeus to show him one last mercy. A lashing snapped and a beam fell on Jason, killing him.|accurate
